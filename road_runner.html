        <p>
            Here at G10 Academy we work to physically develop our athletes while at the same time continue to train
            them to perform at a high level during their sports seasons. The ultimate goal of any program we provide is
            to train our athletes to physically meet the demands of their sport, train them to perform at a high level,
            and to develop lean muscle, to protect their connective tissue, and flexibility to prevent injuries.
